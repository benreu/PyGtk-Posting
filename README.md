This is a open, user driven project, so feel free to submit patches, criticism, or offer to test for bugs (and unknown features). At this time it is alpha, and it will stay that way until it has a broader user base. 

I use it extensively to run my business and am always fixing things and trying to make it better. There are several other users at this time.
