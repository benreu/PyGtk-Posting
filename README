First of all, this program is designed and tested for Linux. The download history on SourceForge shows that this program is downloaded predominately by Mac and Windows. While it could theoretically run on both, there is a lot of porting to be done. If you have extensive knowledge of Mac or Windows, give it a whirl and let me know how you make out. If you are looking for an accounting system for those two platforms, just get Quickbooks or Gnucash or ... 

This accounting system is for people who refuse to be tied to platforms that don't care about the user. If you don't know what means, just spend your valuable time doing something else.

About the name PyGtk Posting

It stands for PYthon + GTK + POSTgresql. The postgresql part has been modified to Posting (an action of posting to an account). The name has nothing to do with PYGTK which is a Python abstraction library based on Gtk2. PyGtk Posting actually uses the newer style GObject Introspection, which allows Python to access any function, procedure, object or whatever within the Gtk platform.

Special credits

py3o is used for all report printouts and invoices. It has the most lowly job there is and is not appreciated half enough. Without py3o, PyGtk Posting would be worthless. Since it is not in the program name it deserves a special credit here.

Reason for existence

My personal need for an accounting system that is small business friendly. It is inspired by GnuAccounting. I wanted a standalone app (not web based) that relies on open source community driven software. While all open source projects need financing to go somewhere, I despise programs that are *free* but require a payment to *unlock* the really useful features.

Install

No need to install PyGtk Posting, just extract the folder somewhere and run the run.sh.

Problems 

Send me the log.txt that is created when you try to run the run.sh. Better yet, figure out what went wrong and tell me where I need to improve :)

Helping

Python/Gtk/SQL programmers are wanted very much! Testing, documentation or a dedicated website for Posting would be much appreciated too.
As there are no preparations for a donation account, donating is not very easy. 
Suggestions/feature requests are wanted in the worst way. What do you wish other accounting apps had? What features do you use day by day? 
And of course bug reports are welcome anytime. 
Do you know of a place to create awareness of this app? Let me hear about it as I want to build this accounting app in a community fashion.

Hacking

Install Anjuta, then open the 'pygtk_posting.anjuta' file with Anjuta. As of this time there are almost no *good* tutorials available for Anjuta. So you are on your own. A very nice polite email to me with a specific question will probably generate a response.

Hacking 

PyGtk Posting uses Git for version tracking. If you don't know Git, please contact me for alternatives.
